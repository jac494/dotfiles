# Notes for Drew Conner dotfiles

## Improvements

* add linting to pre-commit
  * shell
  * markdown
* need to figure out where the best place for storing a bootstrap "minimum installed software list" might live and an overall "drew full linux setup software list" should live- likely ansible for both of these and not dotfiles
